Lorem Ipsum Generator

*Comatose* is a micro CMS designed for being embedded into existing Rails 
applications.

It's intended for simple CMS support. Comatose supports 

 * Nested pages
 * Versioning
 * Page markup in Textile, Markdown, RDoc, or easily add your own 
 * Page processing through Liquid or ERb
 * Generators for easy installation/migration
 * Completely self-contained within plugin folder

It's meant to be lean, mean, easily embedded, and easy to re-skin for 
existing applications. If you need something more, I would recommend 
looking into Radiant.
