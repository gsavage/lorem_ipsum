Lorem Ipsum Generator
=====================

Install the plugin using the usual

script/plugin install git://github.com/gsavage/lorem_ipsum.git

Using the generator:

script/generate lorem_ipsum

That will add a file to your lib directory, and to app/helpers

To use the helper:

<%= lorem_ipsum %>  (Generates a chunk of it as raw text with \n line breaks)

<%= lorem_ipsum(25) %>  (Generates approximate number of bytes of it as raw text with \n line breaks)

<%= lorem_ipsum(25, "<br/>") %>   (Generates approximate number of bytes of it as raw text with \n line breaks converted to <br/>)


It's rough and ready.
